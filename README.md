# C In-Memory Database Server

*Still in Progress*

In-memory database server written in C from scratch. Using this project to refresh my skills in C (low-level programming),
data structure fundamentals, and network protocols. I also want to better understand in-memory databases such as Redis. View current source-code in `database.c`. PLEASE NOTE: **this project is still work in progress and this repo is only to document my progress**.
